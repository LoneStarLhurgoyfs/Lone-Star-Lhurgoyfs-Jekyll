 *(There'll be a real poster shortly!)*
 
 **Location:** 4th Tap Brewing Cooperative (10615 Metric Blvd, Austin TX 78758)   
 **Entry Fee:** $10   
 **Registration:** 12:30, with a 1:00 start time. WE WILL FIRE AT 1:00 SHARP   
 **Payout:** 100% to Top 4; high-end playmat and invite to year-end championship for 1st Place; door prizes for Last Place & Sweetest Deck   
 **Proxy limit:** Unlimited proxy   
 **Proxy rules:** While we love real cards and beautifully-rendered proxies, it’s more important to us that you’re just here and playing. As such, we’re not instituting any proxy rules or guidelines.   
 **Decklists:** We will be collecting decklists to post online after the event.   
 
 You might have noticed that not only is this event on a Sunday, it's Memorial Day Weekend. We've had quite a few people tell us they can't make it out to our Saturday events, so we thought a Sunday tournmanet might be a nice change of pace for the holiday weekend. 
 
 Also of note: 4th Tap normally doesn't open until 4:00 on Sundays, but they appreciate us so much that they're opening early to let us play! ***Given that, please, please, please buy lots of beer from them.*** They're a great brewery and have been hugely supportive in making this tournament series happen, so let's return the favor and get drunk!
