Our July Old School event was a blast, but it's time to get back to our Vintage roots and go Dack To School!

**Location:** [Hopfields](https://hopfieldsaustin.com/) - 3110 Guadalupe St [[MAP](https://goo.gl/maps/3jzRqfxVtcC2)]   
**Entry Fee:** $10   
**Registration:** 10:30 registration, with an 11:00 start time   
**Payout:** 100% of entry fees go to the top Top 4; high-end playmat and invite to year-end championship for 1st Place   
**Proxy limit:** Unlimited proxy   
**Proxy rules:** While we love real cards and beautifully-rendered proxies, it’s more important to us that you’re just here and playing. As such, we’re not instituting any proxy rules or guidelines.   
**Decklists:** We will be collecting decklists to post online after the event.   

If you're new to Vintage, you can find [the current Vintage Restricted List here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/vintage)! Wanna be a metagaming scumbag? Check out [the lists people have played in our past events here](https://lonestarlhurgoyfs.com).

As always, we've got a sweet playmat for 1st-place! What could be better for our back-to-school edition than Show And Tell (complete with a Laubenstein signature)?
