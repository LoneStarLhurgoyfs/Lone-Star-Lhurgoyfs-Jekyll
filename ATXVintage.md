 **Romancing The Stones is back for more Proxy Vintage!**
 
 *(cool poster pending)*
 
 
 **Location:** 4th Tap Brewing Cooperative (10615 Metric Blvd, Austin TX 78758)   
 **Entry Fee:** $10   
 **Registration:** 12:30, with a 1:00 start time. WE WILL FIRE AT 1:00 SHARP - 4th Tap has another event at 7:00, so we need to run on time!   
 **Payout:** 100% to Top 4; Abyss playmat and invite to year-end championship for 1st Place; door prizes for Last Place & Sweetest Deck
 **Proxy limit:** Unlimited proxy   
 **Proxy rules:** While we love real cards and beautifully-rendered proxies, it’s more important to us that you’re just here and playing. As such, we’re not instituting any proxy rules or guidelines.   
 **Decklists:** We will be collecting decklists to post online after the event.
