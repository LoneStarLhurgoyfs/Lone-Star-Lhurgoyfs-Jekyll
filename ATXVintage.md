After an [intense 2018 invitational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM1p-6gbMX0&list=PLoS_340JdZr_RhsKNHlksFzOZecnQk5Gt) and a [brief respite in Old School](https://lonestarlhurgoyfs.com/2019-01-22-20-January-2019-Results/), we’re back to kick off the 2019 season of Romancing The Stones! Come release all your pent-up desire to abuse the restricted list, while partaking in some good food and beer.


**Location:** Hopfields ([3110 Guadalupe Street](https://goo.gl/maps/ZajqCuWERE22))   
**Entry Fee:** $10   
**Time:** 10:30 registration, with an 11:00 start time   
**Payout:** 100% of entry fees go to the top Top 4; “special prize” (TBA) and invite to year-end championship for 1st Place   
**Proxy Limit:** Unlimited proxy   
**Proxy Rules:** While we love real cards and beautifully-rendered proxies, it’s more important to us that you’re just here and playing. As such, we’re not instituting any proxy rules or guidelines.   
**Decklists:** We will be collecting decklists to post online after the event.
