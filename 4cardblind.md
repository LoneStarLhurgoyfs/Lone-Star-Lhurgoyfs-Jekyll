### Round 1

#### Highlights

* **Arjune Bacala v Stephen Bacala:** Stephen waits until turn 3 to cast a Ramunap Excavator off of Cavern of Souls. He lays the beats down while recurring Strip Mine against a deck with only one land.   
* **Arjune Bose v Sam Craven:** Arjune takes nine turns to cheat out a **Chancellor of the Annex**, at which point Sam can no longer attack with Mishra's Factory. The game ends in a draw.
