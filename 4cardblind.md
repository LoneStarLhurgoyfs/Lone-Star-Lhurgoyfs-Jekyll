### Round 5

#### Highlights

* **Elijah Henly** , for getting away with playing a banned card. (It actually had no effect on results. Any sol land would've worked in this slot, as **David London** showed.)
* **Balance** finally gets the axe!
* **Ben Kendrick** plays a fair deck.
* **Chad Moss** becomes the first person to get 0 points in a round.

### Round 4

#### Highlights

* **Joe Kington** becomes the first player to win twice.
* Seriously... the decks are their own highlight.
* **Sam Craven** for running Back a version of a previous winning deck, and then getting last.

### Round 3

#### Highlights

* **Elijah Henly vs Sam Craven** decided to change up the format and instead play a round of Legacy with Turbo Depths vs Sneak and Show
* **Patrick Brennan vs Ben Kendrick:** Sean's heart goes out to the Infect players who can't escape the Punishing Grove combo, even in a four card format.
* Play vs Draw had zero impact on match results in this round.

### Round 2

#### Highlights

* Sam Craven accidentally registered Ornithopter instead of **Memnite**.

### Round 1

#### Highlights

* **Arjune Bacala v Stephen Bacala:** Stephen waits until turn 3 to cast a Ramunap Excavator off of Cavern of Souls. He lays the beats down while recurring Strip Mine against a deck with only one land.   
* **Arjune Bose v Sam Craven:** Arjune takes nine turns to cheat out a **Chancellor of the Annex**, at which point Sam can no longer attack with Mishra's Factory. The game ends in a draw.
