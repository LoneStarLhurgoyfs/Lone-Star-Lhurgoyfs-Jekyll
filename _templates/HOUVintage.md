# Decklists

Decklists are required. We do not perform deck checks but we want lists so we can post them. Have bad handwriting? Use the decklist generator [here](https://decklist.org)! Please don't put anything on your decklist that you don't want to be seen publicly as your decklist may be scanned and uploaded in full.

You may also email your decklist *as plain text* to sam at lonestarlhurgoyfs dot com the day of the tournament.

**It would be greatly appreciated if your decklist was filled out and ready *before* our scheduled start time of 12 PM**
