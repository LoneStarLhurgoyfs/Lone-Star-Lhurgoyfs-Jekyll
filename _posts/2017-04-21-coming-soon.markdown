[Sam](https://twitter.com/thecravenone) is currently working on getting the site built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Until he does, go check out [The Mana Drain](http://themanadrain.com/). There's some super cool stuff over there including [the details for our tournament coming up this weekend at Brash Brewing Co](http://themanadrain.com/topic/1134/4-23-17-houston-texas-100-proxy-vintage-at-brash-brewing-co-akh-allowed).

You might see some older posts popping up. Those are from Sam adding old results and TMD posts.

Cheers!

Sam Craven
