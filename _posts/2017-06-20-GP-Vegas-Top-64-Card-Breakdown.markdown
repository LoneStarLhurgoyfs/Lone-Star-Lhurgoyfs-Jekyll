THIS IS AN EDUCATED GUESS

Only the top sixteen decks and the decks of people undefeated in on-site GPTs were published for this event. Due to the lack of decklists, I've had to make some assumptions. For decks that were represented in the top sixteen, I've assumed that the highest-placing decklist is representative of all decks that share its name. For decks with no decklists published for GP Vegas, I've selected what I believe to be a "standard" build to represent that deck. You may find those decklists below.

Deck names are based on the 63 decks listed in the Reddit attempt to have all decks in the top 64.
