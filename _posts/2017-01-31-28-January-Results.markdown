Eight Vintage players made the journey to Asgard this week to battle in Magic's most ancient format, including two new faces! We look forward to next tournament when we can hopefully get all the regulars *and* these new people in for a more competitive tournament.

To ensure players get as much Vintage as possible, we always play four rounds. Unfortunately, this time around, the top two tables in round four were able to draw in to guarantee they locked up the top four. Fortunately, everyone still hung around to play the final round, just for kicks.

[Top 4 have been submitted to TCDecks CLICK HERE](http://www.tcdecks.net/deck.php?id=21975). 

Next all-proxy Vintage tournament is in two weeks, Sunday 11 February at 1:00 PM.
