We *always* play at least four rounds at Asgard. With only eight people turning out today, that means that the results ended up being quite tight. Split to top four went down to the *second* tie breaker and one more player (me :/ ) was on the same number of wins.

![Results](https://images.lonestarlhurgoyfs.com/old-images/18Dec2016Results.jpg)

A couple people wanted to go watch Star Wars so we split top four. Decks were as follows:

Sky G - Holy shit that's hateful shops
Nick P - Metalworker Shops
Patrick B - URw Pyromancer
Tim E - U Belcher
Elijah H - Paradoxical Mentor
Sam C - Tiny Robots
Joe K - Thalia Tribal
Will M - Grixis Welder
