As with Brash, 4th Tap is manned by a bunch of people every bit as nerdy as we are.

But unlike Brash, we'll be in air conditioning, possibly with a food truck available! (More info as we have it.)

We have a Stanley-Cup-esque playmat. Each tournament, the playmat is be inscribed with the date, location, and winner of the tournament, along with some space for the player to add a doodle. This playmat will be passed each week to the new champion to play with at the next tournament! The finished mat from last season looks like this:

Austinites: A bunch of Houstonians will be coming in from out of town. If you've got recommendations for food and drink, or would like to join us for some, please reach out!

If you or someone you know needs a deck and is too lazy to use a printer or doesn't know what they want, we usually have a few available to borrow. You're welcome to take them home. We only ask that you buy us a new pack of sleeves so we can replace the deck.

Decklists are required. We do not perform deck checks but we want lists so we can post them. Have bad handwriting? Use the decklist generator [here](https://decklist.org)! Blank deck registration sheets will be available on site. Please don't put anything on your decklist that you don't want to be seen publicly as your decklist may be scanned and uploaded in full.

**It would be greatly appreciated if your decklist was filled out and ready *before* our scheduled start time of 1PM.**
