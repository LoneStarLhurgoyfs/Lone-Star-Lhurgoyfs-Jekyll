It's been warm this week in Houston. Fortunately, we got a slight reprieve for the weekend. The National Weather Service reported temperatures in the lower seventies as I hopped in my car, turned up some [Girl Talk](https://vimeo.com/17194640) and headed to the home of the best beer in Houston.

We were one short of tying our record with thirteen players today. That included two players who had never played with us before. We continued to maintain our record of *always* having a new player win at least one match. For the third tournament in a row, a new player has taken second place!

Sam begun this tournament by doing exclusively fair things like casting Tendrils with storm at 26 on turn 1.

This fariness continued in game two of round one, when this was placed onto the stack.

Rufus is the oldest person here.

Naturally, the two new players had to be paired against each other at least once. Stephen looks to be thoroughly in control here.

Patrick is having none of my shenanigans.

Darlin heard a rumor that you might be wanting to donate your pizza crusts to the "I wanna be fat" campaign.

Darlin appears to be satiated. For now.
