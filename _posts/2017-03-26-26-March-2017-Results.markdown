[Tournament announcement post](http://themanadrain.com/topic/1063/3-26-17-houston-texas-100-proxy-vintage-at-brash-brewing-co)

This morning, I jumped in my car, rolled down my windows, turned my music as loud as the speakers would reasonably allow, and made the drive over to Brash Brewing Co. This is likely to be one of the last nice Sundays Houston gets before summer kicks in and I was going to get the full experience out of it.

I was met by seven other Vintage players, all hungry for a shot at getting their name on our wrestling belt playmat. Also, all thirsty for exceedingly strong beers.

We yet again maintained our record of having every new player win at least one match. In fact, for the second tournament in a row, a newcomer has taken second place!

Ben takes home the wrestling belt / playmat for the second week in a row. He hopes to get some artists to scribble on it at GP San Antonio. Also, it has its first beer stain!
