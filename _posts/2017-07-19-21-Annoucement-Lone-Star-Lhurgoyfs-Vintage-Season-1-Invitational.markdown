As you may know, for the past few months, the winner of our Vintage tourmanets gets to take home our prize mat. The prize mat is now quite full and we must determine its final owner.

Eight of the most frequent attendees to our Vintage tournaments have been invited for a full round-robin tournament for final bragging rights.

thecrav, why the fuck do I care?

Because **every round will be streamed with commentary!** Tune in Saturday, July 29th at 12:30 PM Eastern to watch 8 Lhurgoyfs play vintage, bullshit, and get drunker as the tournament goes on.

Check back here next week for all eight decklists and the first few rounds of pairings.
