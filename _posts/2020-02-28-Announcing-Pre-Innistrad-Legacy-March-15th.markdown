Have you ever dreamed of living in a world without Griselbrand? A world where miracles never happen? A world where "Rest in Peace" is simply an epitaph only written on Silent Gravestones?

Well now you can.

After seeing [the post about Pre-Innistrad Legacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTGLegacy/comments/f8gwul/preinnistrad_legacy/) on [/r/MTGLegacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTGLegacy/), we got several requests to run an event. So we're doing just that!

# Quick Facts

Date: March 15, 2020  
Location: TBD   
Registration Time: 11:30 AM  
Event Begins: 12:00 PM   
Entry Fee: $10  
Payout: 100% payout to top 4   
Proxy limit: Unlimited proxy

# Rules

We'll be plaing under the same rules that were used in London. All current rules (mulligans, legends, etc) are in place. The banned list is the same as it was the day before Innistrad was released, including Mental Misstep being banned. (Other changes vs the current banned list: Sensei's Divining Top and Gitaxian Probe are legal. Worldgorger Dragon, Land tax, and Black Vice are banned)

# Further Reading About the Format

Unfortunately, as a Misstep-free pre-Innistrad format only existed for ten days, there aren't many decklists available.

* You can find Star City Games' decks from the month preceeding the Innistrad release [[here]](http://old.starcitygames.com/decks/results/format/3/start_date/01-08-2011/end_date/30-09-2011/w_perc/0/g_perc/0/r_perc/0/b_perc/0/u_perc/0/a_perc/0/order_1/finish/limit/25/start_num/0/)
* GP Amsterdam was shortly after Innistrad was released. Find its coverage [[here]](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpams11)

# Decklists

Decklists are required. We do not perform deck checks but we want lists so we can post them. Have bad handwriting? Use the decklist generator [here](https://decklist.org)! Please don't put anything on your decklist that you don't want to be seen publicly as your decklist may be scanned and uploaded in full.

**The Weissman Rule**: Decklists must match the deck that is being played in the event.

You may also email your decklist *as plain text* to sam at lonestarlhurgoyfs dot com the day of the tournament.

**It would be greatly appreciated if your decklist was filled out and ready *before* our scheduled start time of 12 PM**
