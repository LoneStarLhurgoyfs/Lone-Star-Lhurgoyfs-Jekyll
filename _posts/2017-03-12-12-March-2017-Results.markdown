[Tournament announcement post](http://themanadrain.com/topic/1044/3-12-17-houston-texas-100-proxy-vintage-at-brash-brewing-co)

With SXSW starting up to the West and Star City Games hosting a tournament to the North, our attendance was down for this tournament. We continued to grow the community with two newcomers. As is tradition, both managed to win at least one match. In fact, one finished in second place!

[Top 4 has been submitted to TCDecks here.](http://www.tcdecks.net/deck.php?id=22514)

Placing / Name / Deck
1. Ben K- Ballista Shops
2. Ashby G - Merolk
3. Elijah H - Paradoxical Mentor
4. Patrick B - Ballista Shops
5. Chad M - Ballista Shops
6. Tim E - Turbo Depths
7. Joe K - Paradoxical Mentor
8. Adam D - Paradoxical Storm
9.  Sam C - Two Card Monte

Next all-proxy Vintage tournament is in two weeks, Sunday 26 March at 1:00 PM. Location is TBD but will likely be Brash again. They've offered a free crowler to the winner next time around and possibly more!
