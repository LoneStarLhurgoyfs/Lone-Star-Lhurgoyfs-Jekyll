**About Brash Brewing**

Getting there: [[MAP]](https://goo.gl/maps/JbUmv9nZm1B2) Google Maps places 508 a bit off. If you're heading West on Crosstimbers, be in the right lane. Immediately after some apartments, you'll see a small driveway with a tall wooden fence and then some more apartments. That driveway is where you want to be!

Beers: Be warned - Brash exclusively makes strong beers. If you're going to have more than a couple, you should definitely have a DD or use [Uber](https://uber.com/invite/xpd86)/[Lyft](https://lyft.com/ici/SAM51400)!

Most of the tables at Brash are picnic style tables so a playmat would definitely be a good idea.

Prizes:

Cash: We payout ~80% of entry fee in cash top top 4. The remainder is kept to pay for the prize wall, playmat, and tournament expenses.

Brash has offered a free [crowler](http://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/beer/article/what-is-a-crowler-beer) of beer to our first place winner.

We have a Stanley-Cup-esque playmat. Each tournament, the playmat is be inscribed with the date, location, and winner of the tournament, along with some space for the player to add a doodle. This playmat will be passed each week to the new champion to play with at the next tournament! The finished mat from last season looks like this:

If anyone is planning on coming from out of town, please contact one of the Houston crew if you'd like us to arrange something post-Magic. After most big Legacy events, we generally go out as a group to avail ourselves of the city's excellent food and drink options, and we'd love to show them off to you, too!

If you or someone you know needs a deck and is too lazy to use a printer or doesn't know what they want, we usually have a few available to borrow. You're welcome to take them home. We only ask that you buy us a new pack of sleeves so we can replace the deck.

Decklists are required. We do not perform deck checks but we want lists so we can post them. Have bad handwriting? Use the decklist generator [here](https://decklist.org)! Blank deck registration sheets will be available on site. Please don't put anything on your decklist that you don't want to be seen publicly as your decklist may be scanned and uploaded in full.

**It would be greatly appreciated if your decklist was filled out and ready *before* our scheduled start time of 1PM.**
