With a large crop of regulars in Vegas for the Grand Prix and some others out of town for Father's Day,  I don't expect enough people to be available for a full tournament. However, I know that some of us that will be in town want to play Vintage so I'm terming this weekend a "meetup" rather than a tournament.
