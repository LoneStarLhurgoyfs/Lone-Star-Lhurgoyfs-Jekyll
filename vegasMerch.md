# New merch in time for GP Vegas!

This time, I've chosen to go through [Teespring](https://teespring.com). That comes with some pros and cons. The shirts will be cheaper per shirt, they'll be delivered directly to you, and I don't have to handle the orders. But we can't do customization this time around. If you'd like to order your own shirt with customization, I'd be happy to provide you with the files neccessary. Please reach out to me on Twitter or via email.

**In order to be ready in time for Vegas, orders will close Sunday 28 May**
