# Decklists

Decklists are required. We do not perform deck checks but we want lists so we can post them. Have bad handwriting? Use the decklist generator [here](https://decklist.org)! Please don't put anything on your decklist that you don't want to be seen publicly as your decklist may be scanned and uploaded in full.

**The Weissman Rule**: Decklists must match the deck that is being played in the event.

You may also email your decklist *as plain text* to sam at lonestarlhurgoyfs dot com the day of the tournament.

**It would be greatly appreciated if your decklist was filled out and ready *before* our scheduled start time of 12 PM**

# About Brash Brewing

Getting there: [[MAP]](https://goo.gl/maps/JbUmv9nZm1B2) Google Maps places 508 a bit off. If you're heading West on Crosstimbers, be in the right lane. Immediately after some apartments, you'll see a small driveway with a tall wooden fence and then some more apartments. That driveway is where you want to be!

**Beers:** Be warned - Brash exclusively makes strong beers. If yoremoteu're going to have more than a couple, you should definitely have a DD or use [Uber](https://uber.com/invite/xpd86)/[Lyft](https://lyft.com/ici/SAM51400)!

Most of the tables at Brash are picnic style tables so a playmat would definitely be a good idea.

# Prizes

Cash: We pay out 100% of entry fee in cash top top 4 plus a free [crowler](http://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/beer/article/what-is-a-crowler-beer) of beer to our first place winner. (If the first place winner declines, the crowler goes to the highest finishing player who wants it)

# Throne of Eldraine

As with previous Vintage events held on Prerelease weekend, we will be allowing the use of cards from the new set, [Throne of Eldraine](https://scryfall.com/sets/eld?as=grid&order=name). Remember that we allow as many proxies as you can print, so not owning a card is no excuse!
