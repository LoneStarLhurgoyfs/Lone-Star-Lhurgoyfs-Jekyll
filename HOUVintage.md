Getting there: [[MAP]](https://goo.gl/maps/JbUmv9nZm1B2) Google Maps places 508 a bit off. If you're heading West on Crosstimbers, be in the right lane. Immediately after some apartments, you'll see a small driveway with a tall wooden fence and then some more apartments. That driveway is where you want to be!

Beers: Be warned - Brash exclusively makes strong beers. If yoremoteu're going to have more than a couple, you should definitely have a DD or use [Uber](https://uber.com/invite/xpd86)/[Lyft](https://lyft.com/ici/SAM51400)!

Most of the tables at Brash are picnic style tables so a playmat would definitely be a good idea.

Prizes:

Cash: We payout ~100% of entry fee in cash top top 4.

Brash has offered a free [crowler](http://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/beer/article/what-is-a-crowler-beer) of beer to our first place winner.
